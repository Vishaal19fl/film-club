                Cinematography sets and supports the overall look and mood of a film’s
                visual narrative. Each visual element that appears on screen, a.k.a. the
                <a

                of a film, can serve and enhance the story—so it is the cinematographer’s
                responsibility to ensure that every element is cohesive and support the
                story. Filmmakers often choose to spend the majority of their budget on
                high-quality cinematography to guarantee that the film will look
                incredible on the big screen.

            6 Duties and Responsibilities of a Cinematographer
          </h3>

                  >Chooses a visual style for the film</strong
                >. A cinematographer determines the visual style and approach of the
                film. For example, a cinematographer on a documentary film determines
                whether to use re-enactments, or to rely heavily on photographs and
                found footage.
              </li>
              <li class="article-body__list-item mc-my-4">

                  >Establishes the camera setup for every shot</strong
                >. A cinematographer decides which types of cameras, camera lenses,
                camera angles, and camera techniques best bring the scene to life.
                Additionally, a cinematographer works with the script supervisor and, if
                necessary, the locations manager to scope out each scene and design what
                the most effective vantage points for the camera will be. This helps
                preserve the intention and scale of the film.
              </li>
              <li class="article-body__list-item mc-my-4">
                <strong class="article-body__double_emphasis mc-text--bold"
                  >Determines the lighting for every scene</strong
                >. A cinematographer uses lighting to create the right visual mood the
                director aspires to achieve. They must know how to enhance an image’s
                depth, contrast, and contour to support the story’s atmosphere.
              </li>

                  >Explores the potential of every location</strong
                >. A good cinematographer understands what visuals excite the director
                and can make recommendations about what shots to capture.

                  >Attends rehearsals</strong
                >. A cinematographer attends rehearsals with the actors since the
                blocking for a scene will likely change and evolve. During rehearsals,
                cinematographers adjust the camera in response to a particular gesture
                or action, and as actors adjust their body positions and blocking, to
                better fit the framing of the shot.

            Cinematographers should think carefully about every shot, considering the
            angle, the light, and the camera movement, because there is an infinite
            number of choices they can make. Common cinematography techniques and
            terms include:

              Tracking shot: a sideways-moving shot that captures a landscape or that
