          <h3>How is Direction important?</h3>
          
          <div class="screen">
            <p>
              Film directing is a crucial element in the movie-making industry. The way in
              which it is done drastically affects the outcome and success of the film.
              Not only are directors involved in the artistic conceptualizing of films,
              but they perform several important roles that contribute to the overall
              outcome of the final product. As a business or individual who wishes to have
              a film made, it is advisable to hire a professional company who will supply
              you with the best director to create your ideal film.
            </p>
            <h3>What Does a Film Director Do?</h3>
            <p>
              Essentially, this is the person who controls the film directing; in other
              words, the making of the film. This covers several areas:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Oversees the artistic and dramatic aspects such as the visualization of
                the screenplay (the film’s script)
              </li>
              <li>
                Ensures the rest of the crew, including the actors and technical staff,
                are part of making that vision a reality
              </li>
              <li>Decides upon the cast, the production design and the final script</li>
              <li>
                Gives direction to the rest of the team by creating a general vision for
                them to follow
              </li>
              <li>Motivates and inspires the film crew</li>
              <li>
                Must be a good mediator when opinions differ in terms of creative visions
                for the film
              </li>
              <li>
                Must always keep in mind the film’s budget when striving to fulfill the
                creative vision
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Variety in Film Directing Approaches</h3>
            <p>
              Some film directors tend to control every aspect of the film and require
              that their guidelines and instructions are very closely followed by the rest
              of the team. On the other hand, some prefer to offer an overall image of the
              plot and design, allowing the actors to improvise the dialogue and
              contribute to the creative process. In some cases, the directors write the
              script, act in the film and even compose the music for it. Film directing is
              thus a multi-faceted aspect of movie production.
            </p>
            <h3>How Do You Get Involved in Film Directing?</h3>
            <p>
              There are several ways in which somebody can enter a career as a film
              director. While some directors study at film schools and obtain tertiary
              education in the field, others begin as screenwriters, cinematographers,
              actors or film editors. A qualification is not obligatory, but undoubtedly
              gives someone a head start in the industry.
            </p>
            <h3>Tips for Getting into the Industry</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If studying is not for you, it is possible to work your way up into the
                industry without a bachelor’s degree. Starting off as a screenwriter or
                actor, for example, is a good way to learn about the film industry and
                begin your journey towards directing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Earning a degree in a related field such as Fine Arts helps develops
                creative thinking and critical analysis of information and imagery. Other
                valuable courses are things such as storytelling, writing and film
                history.
              </li>
              <li>
                Doing an internship in the industry will give you a good idea of the
                ins-and-outs of film directing, and whether or not it is for you.
              </li>
              <li>
                Overall, it is vital that you are creatively-minded and have a talent for
                film creation. It is also important to become connected within the
                industry.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you are wanting to have a film made for your business, the director will
              be essential in its success. This person will work closely with you to get a
              clear idea of what it is you are wanting to say or achieve with the film.
              Hiring a professional company to provide you with the necessary people for
              the making of your film is strongly advisable.
