                  A good film is generally the one that can appeal to multiple senses all at
                  once and evoke a certain emotion or reaction to it. Music is one such medium
                  that can heighten and stimulate the sense of hearing and make the film an
                  even more enjoyable one. Music has been an integral part of a movie for a
                  long time. There are many examples of
                  <a 
                    >iconic</a
                  >
                  theme music from movies that has become more popular than the movie. The
                  moment you hear it, you get reminded of the film.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                  There have been cases where many have been intrigued by the music of a film
                  and have gone to see it for that sake. The conditioning of the mind is such
                  that imagining a movie without music is almost impossible. Since the music
                  also sets the tone and complements the movie appropriately, it does play a
                  significant role in the storyline. More details about this synergistic
                  relationship are explained in detail here.
                </p>
              
                <p ><strong>Music and Film Liaison</strong></p>
              
                <p>
                  A liaison is a strong communication that is established between multiple
                  entities so that a close relationship is established between them, and it
                  helps each other’s cause. The best example is music and film liaison. The
                  popularity of both is interrelated as both contribute to the success of each
                  other. Movie making is mainly for entertainment purposes, but the business
                  aspect of it is also pretty significant. Music and film help each other’s
                  cause in this regard as well.
                </p>
              
                <p style="text-align: center">
                  
                  <h3>Film music is basically of two types:</h3>
                </p>
              
                <p><strong>Diegetic music</strong></p>
              
                <p>
                  This is the type of music that is integrated within the story-line itself.
                  For example, an instrument being played in a movie scene, like
                  <a >music lessons</a> being
                  given by one of the characters.
                </p>
              
                <p><strong>Non-diegetic music</strong></p>
              
                <p>
                  This is the version of the music that is not a part of the story-line as
                  such, but is played in the background for dramatization. For example, the
                  music that’s heard during a chase scene or a murder, which is from an
                  external source and does not have any origin within.
                </p>
              
                <p style="text-align: center">
                  <h3>Impact of music on the story-line</h3>
                </p>
              
                <p>
                  There have been many, many movies that have run on the back of
                  <a >good music</a>
                  significantly.
                </p>
              
               
              
                <p>
                  The type of music that plays during a movie plays a significant role in
                  underlining what is being portrayed in terms of the development of the
                  storyline. It can change the perception that a person has of a situation.
                  Thus, it can act as a guiding light.

                    >Music sets the
                    <a 
                      >rhythm</a

                </p>
              
                <p>
                  It is due to this reason that filmmakers give a lot of importance to music.
                  The attention of the viewer is captured, and a sense of anticipation and
                  anxiety is created, which is desirable to set the mood correctly. Thus, the
                  rhythm is set, and people fall into the groove of the film more easily.
                </p>
              
                
              
                <p>
                  As mentioned before, excellent and ambient music can set up a movie better
                  and create the kind of atmosphere which corresponds to the genre it belongs
                  to. Viewers often feel glued to their seat while watching a movie, and music
                  heard in the background will have a huge role to play in this respect.
                </p>
              
                <p style="text-align: center">
                  <h3>Ability to articulate intricate expressions</h3>
                </p>
              
                <p>
                  Cues related to hearing are stored in the subconscious for a long time.
                  People often associate scenes in their favourite movies with the music
                  running throughout them. Thus, the recall ability of the person becomes even
                  better with the right kind of music for movies.
                </p>
              
                
              
                <p>
                  A story can move a long way forward on the shoulders of good music.
                  Intricate and subtle expressions can be elaborated through it.
                </p>
              
                <p style="text-align: center"><h3>Viewers Retention</h3></p>
              
                <p>
                  When a filmmaker makes a movie, he or she wants the viewer to remember it
                  for an extended period. The retention by the viewer is generally largely
                  governed by the type of music that is a part of the movie.
                </p>
              
                
              
                <p>
                  So, as we discussed, music is an integral part of a film. It helps the
                  audience to understand the story-line as music portrays a situation better
                  than words. It stays in memory for a longer period of time, and it
                  ultimately helps a film become loved and remembered. Next time you venture
                  into a feature length movie, pay attention to the soundtrack and the effect
                  it has on the overall experience.
                </p>
